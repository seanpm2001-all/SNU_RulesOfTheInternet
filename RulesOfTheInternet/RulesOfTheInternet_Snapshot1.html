<p>I was originally going to just make a modified version of the rule 34 to meet moral standards, and I took the entire original 100 rules of the internet (meme from 2012) and I am keeping an archive of it here, along with a modified version to fit SNU morals.</p>
<p>It is still a work in progress. WARNING! Some content may be offensive to some viewers.</p>
<p>I do not intend to ruin the meme, if I ruined the meme for you I am really sorry. This is not intended to be a fellow kids thing.</p>
